Foreign.CPP
===========

C++ type wrappers and utility functions for easy interop with C++ libraries. See my 
[post](www.acomar.net/posts/2014-04-25-Foreign-CPP-Useful-Types-For-CPP-Interop.html) for a clearer picture of
the goal for this library.

I'll update this with examples of the intended usage once the user story is something other than edit this library
until it suits your needs.
